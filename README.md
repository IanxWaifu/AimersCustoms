## 📚 Lore Archetypes

> These Archetypes are **story-driven designs**, deeply connected to the lore of Aimer’s Customs.  
> They are built to reflect the history, characters, and themes of the verse that I have created over the past decade.  
> Each deck emphasizes **flavor, narrative, and thematic synergy**, while still offering unique mechanics for gameplay.

<summary><strong>Deathrall</strong></summary>

### Lore
*TBD*

### Playstyle
A Link- and Token-based Deck with supplemental Fusion Monsters.

The core concept is to summon the **“Legion”** by generating Legion Tokens through Spells and each Link Monster. Your Link Monsters can be Link Summoned using different variations of materials, and depending on the variation used, they gain different abilities.

The goal is to cycle through different monster types to create effects that best suit your needs.

<summary><strong>Azhimaou</strong></summary>

### Lore
*TBD*

### Playstyle
A Ritual, Synchro, and Fusion-based Deck.

The core mechanic revolves around Ritual Spells that Set Spell/Traps to your field as Ritual Material based on the Level of the Ritual Monster being summoned. Higher Levels allow you to place more cards, but steepen the activation cost.

Those Spell/Traps also have inherent activation costs: reducing your monsters’ Levels by 4.  
If a monster’s Level would become 0, it destroys itself.

<a id="iron-saga"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Iron Saga</strong></summary>

### Lore
The **Tetra Core** is an ancient artifact that channels immense mystical energy across the galaxy of Orion. Linked to it are the **Four Ordinals**, elemental forces embodying nature’s raw power.

Andrea Meteora, orphaned at a young age after losing her spiritualist parents and raised without knowledge of her true lineage, is uniquely chosen to bridge the gap between the Tetra Core and the Ordinals. With a blend of innate spiritual connection and technological ingenuity, she activates the **Full Ordinal Link**, merging with the elemental might of the Ordinals.

This transformation allows her to fend off the relentless Daedra attack and halt their takeover of Orion. However, the overwhelming power drains the Tetra Core, forcing the Ordinals into deep stasis until it can regenerate. Andrea’s journey is defined by sacrifice and resilience as she stands against encroaching darkness.

### Playstyle
A Level 7 **Cyborg Spirit** Archetype.

- Uses a looping **Ordinal Scale** (1st → 4th → reset)
- Main Deck monsters return to the hand like traditional Spirits
- Monsters can Summon the previous or next Ordinal in the Scale
- Extra Deck monsters also check Ordinal order
- Returning all four Ordinals to your hand enables an Xyz Summon
- This Xyz Summon can be performed during either player’s turn

<summary><strong>Zodiakieri</strong></summary>

### Lore
*TBD*

### Playstyle
A **Spirit Ritual Archetype** that utilizes Extra Deck Ritual Monsters and Extra Deck Spells.

All Spell/Traps in the Deck cannot be activated normally and must be triggered through monster effects (except for the Field and Ritual Spells).

When the Ritual Monsters are Summoned, they Set their respective Spell directly from the Extra Deck to your field.

</details>

<a id="kijin"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Kijin</strong></summary>

### Lore
The Kijin were a proud and noble race from the Fourth Star of Stellaria, living in harmony with their lush world. Their downfall began with the slow spread of a corrupting miasma from the **Divine-Eye**, which fed on ambition and desire.

Lies and division tore the Kijin apart, plunging them into civil war. As the corruption deepened, their world was reduced to ruin, and the Kijin lost all sense of their former identity—becoming twisted remnants of what they once were.

### Playstyle
A Fire Fiend Ritual Archetype that utilizes unique Continuous Spell/Traps with lingering effects.

- Continuous effects persist for 1–2 turns after leaving the field
- Effects are small but meant to stack
- Monsters use Continuous cards as costs
- Rituals require specific Archetype monsters as material
- Ritual Spells can Special Summon materials while still treating them as used

### Playstyle
A Fusion Archetype revolving around **space and time**.

Certain cards allow you to Fusion Summon using monsters from the Deck, GY, or Extra Deck. While the Fusions themselves are not particularly strong, they excel at swarming and generating recursive advantage—creating a looping space-time engine.

The Synchro Monsters can only be Summoned at the start of **your** Battle Phase. Your Main Deck monsters gain different effects depending on whether it is the first Battle Phase and/or an Additional Battle Phase.

Planned rename: **Umiku** (double entendre).

<summary><strong>Girls & Arms</strong> <em>(Non-Lore)</em></summary>
