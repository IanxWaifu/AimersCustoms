## \*\*Playstyle\*\*
A Ritual-, Synchro-, and Fusion-based Deck focused on transforming Spell and Trap Cards into Ritual Materials.

The core concept is to perform Ritual Summons by using Ritual Spells that Set Spell/Trap Cards to your field and treat them as Ritual Material based on the Level of the Ritual Monster being Summoned. Higher-Level Ritual Monsters allow you to place more Spell/Trap Cards, but increase the activation investment required.

Those Spell/Trap Cards also possess inherent activation costs that reduce your monsters’ Levels by 4. If a monster’s Level would become 0 through this reduction, it destroys itself.

The Deck revolves around managing Level resources while transitioning Ritual Monsters into Synchro and Fusion plays to maintain field presence and advantage.

- Transitioning Ritual Monsters into Synchro and Fusion Summons

## \*\*Design Notes\*\*
Designed to feel like invoking unstable magical contracts where increasing power comes at escalating risk. The archetype rewards players who carefully manage Level values and sequence their Spell/Trap usage to prevent self-destruction while maximizing Ritual output.
