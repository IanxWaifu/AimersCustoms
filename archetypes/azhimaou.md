## Overview
Azhimaou is a ritual-driven archetype built around converting Spell and Trap Cards into summoning resources while managing monster Levels as a volatile cost system.

## Lore
*TBD*

## Playstyle
A Ritual-, Synchro-, and Fusion-based Deck.

The core concept is to perform Ritual Summons using Ritual Spells that Set Spell/Trap Cards to your field and treat them as Ritual Material based on the Level of the Ritual Monster being Summoned. Higher Levels allow you to place more cards, but steepen the activation investment required.

Those Spell/Trap Cards also have inherent activation costs: reducing your monsters’ Levels by 4. If a monster’s Level would become 0, it destroys itself.

The goal is to carefully manage Level resources while transitioning Ritual Monsters into Synchro and Fusion plays to maintain advantage.
