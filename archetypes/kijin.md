## Overview
Kijin is a Fire Fiend Ritual archetype built around stacking lingering Continuous Spell and Trap effects while sacrificing stability for escalating power.

---

## Lore
The Kijin were a proud and noble race from the Fourth Star of Stellaria, living in harmony with their lush world. Their downfall began with the slow spread of a corrupting miasma from the Divine-Eye, which fed on ambition and desire.

Lies and division tore the Kijin apart, plunging them into civil war. As the corruption deepened, their world was reduced to ruin, and the Kijin lost all sense of their former identity—becoming twisted remnants of what they once were.

## Playstyle
A Fire Fiend Ritual-based Deck centered around persistent Continuous Spell and Trap effects.

The core concept is to establish Continuous Spell/Trap Cards whose effects linger for 1–2 turns even after they leave the field. Individually, these effects are minor, but they are designed to stack over time to create mounting pressure.

Kijin monsters use Continuous cards as activation costs, converting long-term value into immediate advantage. Ritual Monsters require specific archetype monsters as material, reinforcing internal synergy and identity.

Ritual Spells can Special Summon the materials used while still treating them as properly consumed for the Ritual Summon, allowing the Deck to maintain board presence while progressing its strategy.
