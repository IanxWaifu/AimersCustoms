## Playstyle
A Link- and Token-based Deck with supplemental Fusion Monsters.

The core concept is to summon the **“Legion”** by generating Legion Tokens through Spells and each Link Monster. Your Link Monsters can be Link Summoned using different variations of materials, and depending on the variation used, they gain different abilities.

The goal is to cycle through different monster types to create effects that best suit your needs.

## Design Notes
