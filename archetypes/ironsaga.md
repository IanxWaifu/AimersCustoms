## Overview
Iron Saga is a Spirit-based archetype centered around cycling through elemental Ordinals while maintaining resource loops through returning monsters to the hand.

## Lore
The Tetra Core is an ancient artifact that channels immense mystical energy across the galaxy of Orion. Linked to it are the Four Ordinals, elemental forces embodying nature’s raw power.

Andrea Meteora, orphaned at a young age after losing her spiritualist parents and raised without knowledge of her true lineage, is uniquely chosen by the Core to bridge the gap between the Tetra Core and the Ordinals. With a blend of innate spiritual connection and technological ingenuity, she is able to activate the Full Ordinal Link, merging with the elemental might of the Ordinals.

This transformation allows her to fend off the relentless Daedra attack and halt their takeover of Orion. However, the overwhelming shock of power drains the Tetra Core, forcing the Ordinals into deep stasis until it can regenerate. Andrea’s journey is one of sacrifice and resilience as she stands against encroaching darkness.

## Playstyle
A Level 7 Cyborg Spirit-based Deck.

The core concept is to cycle through an Ordinal Scale consisting of four stages that progress sequentially before resetting. Main Deck monsters behave similarly to traditional Spirit monsters by returning to the hand, allowing repeated activation of their effects and maintaining resource flow.

Monsters within the archetype can Summon either the previous or next Ordinal within the Scale, creating a continuous rotation system. Extra Deck monsters also interact with and check Ordinal sequencing to determine their effects and summoning conditions.

Returning all four Ordinals to your hand enables a powerful Xyz Summon that can be performed during either player’s turn, representing the activation of the Full Ordinal Link.
